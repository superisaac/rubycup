=== Prereqirements
P1. Install the ruby language (version >= 1.8.3) from source or any of the binary forms
P2. Install the SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) ruby binding according to instructions on the web site of Ruby/SDL



=== Run match
There are two methods to start a match

==== Method 1: run  the match through ruby script
change directory to the ruby cup folder
then type
>> ruby run_match.rb 

If you want to load different wisdoms, for example moderate wisdom,  you may fill the option of run_match.rb like

>> ruby run_match.rb --teama=stupid --teamb=moderate

which means team A has stupid wisdom and team B has moderate wisdom

type 
>> ruby run_match.rb -h 
or 

>> ruby run_match.rb --help 
for help information

==== Method 2: run the match through XML config files
This method depends on a script mas/run_container.rb which takes a XML file as an  arguments to lauch start up agents
If no XML config file is specified then the container.XML at current directory is the default one
there are two XML config files at the ruby cup's install directory, container.xml and container-moderate.xml, you can choose 
on to launch or write your own XML configure files.

example
>> ruby mas/run_container.rb container-moderate.xml

=== Run monitors
And start sdl monitor by typing
>> ruby sdlmonitor.rb at another console
If everything is OK, there will be a window showing the match.
You can start multiple monitors at the same time


=== Deploy your own wisdom
If you developed your own wisdom you can deply it  on the RubyCUP platform
Assumes that your wisdom's name is $MYWISDOM, the lauching file of your wisdom is $MYWISDOM.rb
S1: you should put every needed scripts including the $MYWISDOM.rb under the folder $RUBYCUP/wisdoms/$WISDOM.
S2: Modify the argument of run_match.rb or container.xml
S3: restart the  match

For details on how to development your own wisdom see the Developer's Guide (Yet to be written) please.
